# rest-oracle-go-seed
A seed repository that contains a Go project that accepts input via a REST API and saves data to an Oracle database.

## Why Oracle?
The cost of an Oracle license is less than the cost of man hours that it would take to convert to another DBMS for most organizations. 

That being said, this seed moduralizes the data access module to make moving to Postgres or SQL server simple. 

## Why Go?
Go lang uses signficantly less resources than Java, and is optimized to be a web development language.

The cloud savings could be significant.
